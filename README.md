üìñ Description:


A Product Showcase is a React application meticulously crafted for the purpose of learning API fetching in a frontend development environment. The primary objective of this showcase is to explore and implement the fundamental concepts and practices associated with making asynchronous API calls in a React application.

üõ†Ô∏èKey Learnings/Technologies Used  : 
Used dummyjson Api to get the details of the products 
Used useState hook  for managing state in functional components. It allows you to declare state variables and update them within your components.

Used useEffect hook to perform side effects in functional components. It is commonly used for actions like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.
In the context of API fetching, useEffect is often employed to initiate the asynchronous operation when the component mounts or when certain dependencies change.

Used async await  :

async/await is a modern syntax for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It simplifies working with promises and makes the code more readable.

When making an API call using fetch, you can use async/await to wait for the promise to resolve and obtain the result. This helps in writing code that looks synchronous but behaves asynchronously:
